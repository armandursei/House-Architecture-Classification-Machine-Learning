# House-Architecture-Classification

◦ Developed two image classification applications using Machine Learning algorithms (one with SVM, other with K-NN and Naive Bayes) to recognize architectural styles. 

◦ Implemented advanced preprocessing (scaling, feature extraction) and a Voting Classifier to combine models and optimize performance (~81% accuracy).
